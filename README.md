# Eye Exercise

## Description
A pair of eyes follows cursor using movement detection. This is an assignment for my MIT xPRO course which requires bringing together skills in JS and CSS to create a dynamic experience.

## How to run
To run this exercise, clone the repository and simply open the file index.html in your preferred browser or just click [here](https://muksis.github.io/eye-exercise/).

## Roadmap of future improvements
Add blinking and a fly following the cursor.
